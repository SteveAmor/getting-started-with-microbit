# Getting Started with Microbits

If you're one of the thousands of school children across the UK to receive a one of the BBC's amazing Microbits, and you want to learn how you can write push code to it from your Raspberry Pi, then this resource will give you a quick and easy setup guide to start you on your journey to exploring the Microbit.

## Downloading and Installing Mu

MicroPython is a small but very fast version of Python3 that has been especially designed to work on microcontrollers, such as those found on the Microbit. To start writing MicroPython code on your Raspberry Pi, it is helpful to have an IDE (Interactive Development Environment), to make things a little easier for you. Luckily, **[mu](https://github.com/ntoll/mu)** is an opensource editor designed especially for children, and can run on your Raspberry Pi.

1. To install mu, you should follow the instructions in the [software install guide](software.md)

1. Once **mu** is installed, you can run it from the terminal. Open LXTerminal and type:

    ```bash
    ./mu
    ```

1. A new window should open up that looks like this:


1. Now do D:

    Wire up the button to pin 17 and ground

1. Now do X

Now we have X

## The Next Step

Now we've done X, we'll do Y.

1. First do A

1. Then do B

1. Now do C in code:

    ```python
    print("Hello world")
    ```

    In Python the `print` function is something

1. Now do D

1. Now do Y

Now we have X and Y
